Strategy
	Our strategy implements the minimax algorithm in ColorWar. In this algorithm, games
	for each possible choice are simulated. Each game is simulated to 3 recursive steps,
	each step being a turn taken by a player. After that the percentage of the board under
	our possession for each choice is returned. Depending on if that choice was made by
	our bot or the other bot, the maximum or minimum of those percentages is return
	respectively. The resulting choice for our bot is the returned.
	
Contribution
	I assisted in implementing minimax into ColorWar as well as doing research on the
	subject.
	Nilai assisted with logic and getting rid of errors.
	
Challenges
	Most of the challenges came from implementing minimax into ColorWar correctly. Also
	simple mistakes such as returning the choice instead of the percentage of the board
	under possession and grabbing the wrong cell from the board existed.
	
The Future
	As for the future, a more accurate description for the heuristic would have been used.
	How ever plans to implement this we scrapped due to criteria and time constraints.
